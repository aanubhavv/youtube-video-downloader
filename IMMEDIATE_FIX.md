# ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE FIX for Chrome Cookies Database Error

## Problem

```
ERROR: could not find chrome cookies database in "/root/.config/google-chrome"
```

## Root Cause

Production servers (Railway, Vercel, etc.) don't have GUI browsers installed, so `YT_DLP_COOKIES_FROM_BROWSER=chrome` fails.

## âœ… Quick Solution

### Step 1: Generate cookies.txt locally

```bash
# On your local computer (with Chrome/Firefox installed)
cd backend
pip install browser-cookie3
python generate_cookies.py
```

### Step 2: Upload cookies.txt to Railway

1. Add `cookies.txt` to your repository
2. Or upload directly to Railway volume/persistent storage

### Step 3: Update Railway Environment Variables

1. **Remove**: `YT_DLP_COOKIES_FROM_BROWSER`
2. **Add**: `YT_DLP_COOKIES_FILE=/app/cookies.txt`

### Step 4: Deploy and Test

```bash
# Test endpoints after deployment
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/cookie-status
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/health
```

## Alternative: Manual Cookie Export

If the script doesn't work, use a browser extension:

1. Install "Get cookies.txt" extension in Chrome/Firefox
2. Visit YouTube.com (make sure you're logged in)
3. Click extension â†’ Export cookies.txt
4. Upload to Railway
5. Set `YT_DLP_COOKIES_FILE=/app/cookies.txt`

## Expected Result

After fix:

```json
{
  "cookie_status": "Using cookies file: /app/cookies.txt",
  "configured": true
}
```

## Security Notes

- Keep cookies.txt secure
- Add to `.gitignore` if committing to repo
- Regenerate if cookies expire (usually 1-2 years)
